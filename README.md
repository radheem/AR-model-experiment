# AR-model-experiment
I have conducted four experiments where first I checked if the data was stationary then plotted its ACF and PACF. Then I applied AR1, AR2, AR3 and AR4 and compared their results in visual plots.
The purpose of this experiment was to see how the predicted values varied as the order(lag) of AR was increased
